### Directions
Create a one page web app using the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.co/api/film).
Refer to  *Spec.png* for an example of how the layout and visual design for this application should work. 

The HTML and CSS has been provided for you. Your job is to write the javascript in app.js and fix any CSS issues with the app (I've created some obvious and intentional problems). 

Before you begin please review the index.html file. The index.html file has examples of existing components that you should bring to life using javascript. 

If you have any questions at all, please ask. There is no penalty for asking questions. So ask :) The test reviewer will tell you if they cannot answer a question related to the coding challenge. 

#### Javascript Libraries
I have provided jQuery and Lodash. You can use both of those libraries (you don't have to) and the internet to look up information and reference documentation. However, please do not include/use any other javascript libraries. 

#### The API
[https://swapi.co/api/films/](https://swapi.co/api/films/)
1. You will be using the films api https://swapi.co/api/films/
2. In order to get data in json format add the following property to the api: https://swapi.co/api/films/?format=json
**NOTE:** If the api is down, you may make the api call to the local data file `http://localhost:8000/data.json`

#### Running a Dev Server
You can run a local dev server by simply using the python server. 
1. Open a terminal
2. cd to the root of the starwars directory
3. run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`
